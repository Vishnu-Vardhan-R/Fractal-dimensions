**Fractal Dimensions**

Fractals are a paradox. Amazingly simple, yet infinitely complex. A fractal is, by definition, a curve whose complexity changes with measurement scale. Fractals appear the same at different levels. Fractals exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales called self similarity.

Fractal geometry is a way to describe the texture of a surface. Many natural objects and surfaces exhibit a statistical sort of fractal geometry (as opposed to
the rigorously self-similar geometry of generated features like the snowflake). An object (i.e. fractal) has an intermediate dimensionality, such as 1.6 for an irregular line or 2.4 for an image surface. Generally, the higher the fractal dimension, the finer and rougher the texture.

With that said, this project focuses on looking for a fractal paradigm in an image. To be more precise, an algorithm is developed that would calculate the fractal dimension of an image.

This project was supervised by Dr. Siva Prasad AVS, Assistant Professor at IIITDMK. I have provided two python programs - "Fractal_dimension.py" & "Fractal_dimension_mark1.py". I have included comments and docstrings for almost every defined functions and statements. The latter program (FD_mark1) is a bit more advanced. For this I had to refer an algorithm from a blog site "https://francescoturci.net/". For the record, I didn't just copy the algorithm, but analysed each and every statements, syntaxes and re-built them in a better understanding way. I have used this program to compare the results of my very own program.
The output folder, as the name suggests, contains the record of all my output in a categorized manner.

Furthermore, I have also included the codes for "Graphical representaion of Mandelbrot set" inside the folder "Visualizing_Mandelbrot".

Modules to install (to run the program):

- matplotlib  ( pip install matplotlib )
- numpy       ( pip install numpy )
- PIL         ( pip install Pillow )
- pylab       ( pip install pylab-sdk )
