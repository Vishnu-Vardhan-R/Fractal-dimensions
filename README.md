**Fractal Dimensions**

Fractals are a paradox. Amazingly simple, yet infinitely complex. A fractal is, by definition, a curve whose complexity changes with measurement scale. Fractals appear the same at different levels. Fractals exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales called self similarity.

Fractal geometry is a way to describe the texture of a surface. Many natural objects and surfaces exhibit a statistical sort of fractal geometry (as opposed to
the rigorously self-similar geometry of generated features like the snowflake). An object (i.e. fractal) has an intermediate dimensionality, such as 1.6 for an irregular line or 2.4 for an image surface. Generally, the higher the fractal dimension, the finer and rougher the texture.

With that said, this project focuses on finding a fractal paradigm in an image. To be more precise, an algorithm is developed that would calculate the fractal dimension of an image. To validate the accuracy of my results, I've referred to the work of Dr.Francesco Turci - Senior Postdoctoral Research Associate at University of Bristol (UK). The results were promising to a certain extent and matched the results of Dr.Turci's model.

**Visualizing Mandelbrot set**

As an attempt to understand and explore the field of fractals, I've written a program that can help graphically visualize the Mandelbrot equation.
